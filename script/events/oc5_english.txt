INTROCINEMATIC1	Hi and welcome to the Opener Challenge!
INTROCINEMATIC2	In this event, you need to complete the objectives by continuing the replay from a premade opener
INTROCINEMATIC3	This time the task is to lift Uke in the air and keep him there for as long as you can!
INTROCINEMATIC4	Good luck and have fun!
INTRO1	Welcome back! Continue making the replay using the premade opener and keep Uke in the air for as long as you can!
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	Check your notifications - there should be a message from Event Squad with the list of prizes you've got!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you haven't met all objectives, feel free to submit a better replay any time later and claim even better prizes!
UPLOADSUCCESS4	It looks like your replay didn't qualify for any new rewards - but hey it's still cool!
