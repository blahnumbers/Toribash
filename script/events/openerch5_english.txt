INTRO1	Hi and welcome to Opener Challenge 5!
INTRO2	In this event you need to make the best replay you can by using a premade opener!
INTRO3	This time, you'll be making a manipulation replay, which means you'd need to keep Uke in the air without grabbing him.
INTRO4	To make sure current Uke height is acceptable, you can toggle the "red zone" with CTRL + V hotkey
INTRO5	Hi again and welcome back! Let's get back to your replay - and don't forget about CTRL + V hotkey to toggle the red zone.
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	If everything's fine, you'll receive your base reward shortly soon - and if you're particularly good, an even better prize after the deadline!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you decide to change your replay entry to another one, please post it in event thread on forums.
UPLOADSUCCESS4	Thanks for participating and see you next time!
