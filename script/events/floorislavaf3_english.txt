INTRO1	Hi and welcome to Floor is Lava!
INTRO2	Complete the map by reaching the glowing red area and get rewards!
INTRO3	Be careful not to touch the floor - or it will melt you down!
INTRO4	Hi again! Let's get back to your auto-saved replay!
INTRO5	Remember, no floor touching unless you want to end up with only half a body!
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	Check your notifications - there should be a message from Event Squad with the list of prizes you've got!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you make an even better replay, feel free to submit it any time to claim even better prizes!
UPLOADSUCCESS4	Your replay didn't get you any new rewards, but you can still try to make a better replay and upload later!
