INTROCINEMATIC1	Hi and welcome to the Opener Challenge!
INTROCINEMATIC2	In this event you need to complete the objectives by making a replay using the premade opener.
INTROCINEMATIC3	This time the task is to damage Uke and get as many points as you can!
INTROCINEMATIC4	Good luck and have fun!
INTRO1	Welcome back! Continue making the replay and try to deal as much damage to Uke as you can!
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	Check your notifications - there should be a message from Event Squad with the list of prizes you've got!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you haven't met all objectives, feel free to submit a better replay any time later and claim even better prizes!
UPLOADSUCCESS4	It looks like your replay didn't qualify for any new rewards - but hey it's still cool!
UPLOADSUCCESS5	Thanks for participating and see you next time!
