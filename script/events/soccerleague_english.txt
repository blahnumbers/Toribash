INTRO1	Hi and welcome to Soccer League!
INTRO2	Score a goal by kicking your own head (aka THE BALL) in either of the gates.
INTRO3	Scoring in the right gate is trickier but would give you better rewards, so can be worth an extra try!
INTRO4	Hi again! Let's get back to your auto-saved replay!
INTRO5	Remember, if you score in the right gate, you'd get you better rewards!
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	Check your notifications - there should be a message from Event Squad with the list of prizes you've got!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you make an even better replay, feel free to submit it any time to claim even better prizes!
UPLOADSUCCESS4	Your replay didn't get you any new rewards, but you can still try to make a better replay and upload later!
UPLOADSUCCESS5	Thanks for participating and see you next time!
