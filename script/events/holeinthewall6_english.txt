INTRO1	*sniff sniff* What's that smell? It's a hole in the wall challenge, of course!
INTRO2	As usual, make a replay where you pass the wall and submit it for review to receive prizes!
INTRO3	Hi again! Let's get back to your auto-saved replay!
UPLOADSUCCESS1	Hooray, you've successfully uploaded your entry!
UPLOADSUCCESS2	If everything's fine, you'll receive your base reward shortly soon - and if you're particularly good, an even better prize after the deadline!
UPLOADSUCCESS3	If you decide to change your replay entry to another one, please post it in event thread on forums.
UPLOADSUCCESS4	Thanks for participating and see you next time!
