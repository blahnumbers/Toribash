DESCDATATEXT 0;1The Event Squad is proud to present Free Run Frenzy!\nThe challenge is simple (or is it?) - get to Uke any manner you can! Parkour your way to the red zone either straight on or take a detour through the extra blue checkpoint area for a better prize!\nAs usual, best replay will receive extra rewards so give your replay some love!\nGood luck at freerunning!
